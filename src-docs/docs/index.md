# Introduction

![Icon](img/durpresets.png)

*DuRPresets* is an add-on for *Blender* which exports and imports all render settings as external presets.

[You can download it here](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/durpresets/).

These presets are stored in *JSON* files, which can be edited with any text editor.

It adds a *Render Presets* section in the *Render Properties* panel, with the two buttons to import and export.

When importing a preset, you can select which part of the preset has to be imported (general settings, cycles settings, eevee settings, output settings...)

*DuRPresets* also exports and imports the settings set with [*DuBlast*](https://rainboxlab.org), an add-on for quickly creating and playing playblasts.
