# Introduction

DuRPresets is an add-on for *Blender* which exports and imports all render settings as external presets.

These presets are stored in *JSON* files, which can be edited with any text editor.

It adds a *Render Presets* section in the *Render Properties* panel, with the two buttons to import and export.

When importing a preset, you can select which part of the preset has to be imported (general settings, cycles settings, eevee settings, output settings...)
